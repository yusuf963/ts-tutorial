## There are a few different ways to join multiple CSV files into one file using the command line on Linux.

One way to achieve this is to use the cat command to concatenate the contents of the CSV files and redirect the output to a new file.
 For example, if you have three CSV files named file1.csv, file2.csv, and file3.csv, you can use the following command to join them
  into a new file named all.csv:
Copy code
cat file1.csv file2.csv file3.csv > all.csv
Another option is to use the awk command. You can use awk to specify a separator and concatenate the contents of the CSV files, for example:
Copy code
awk 'FNR==1 && NR!=1{next;}{print}' file*.csv > all.csv
this command will ignore the first line of each file except for the first one which is the header

A third option is using csvstack command from csvkit package, it allows you to join multiple csv files based on the header of the files, for example:
Copy code
csvstack file1.csv file2.csv file3.csv > all.csv
If you are on a system that have pandas package you can use it in your command line to join multiple csv files by using python script, for example:
Copy code
python -c 'import pandas as pd; df=pd.concat([pd.read_csv(f) for f in ["file1.csv", "file2.csv", "file3.csv"]]); df.to_csv("all.csv", index=False, header=True)'
All the above commands will concatenate the contents of the specified
